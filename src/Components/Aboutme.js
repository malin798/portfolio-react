        My name is Malin Andersson and I started the Technigo Bootcamp in January 2020. During the intense bootcamp I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js. What makes me a great developer is that I am a very structured person and I am always curious to learn more and get feedback on my code.
